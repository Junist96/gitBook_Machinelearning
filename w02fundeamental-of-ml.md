# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

Learn the most classical methods of machine learning
• Rule based approach
• Classical statistics approach
• Information theory appraoch

Rule based machine learning
• How to find the specialized and the generalized rules
• Why the rules are easily broken

Decision Tree
• How to create a decision tree given a training dataset
• Why the tree becomes a weak learner with a new dataset

Linear Regression
• How to infer a parameter set from a training dataset
• Why the feature engineering has its limit
